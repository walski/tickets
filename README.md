Nerdboat is a weekend of 30 developers, designers, web hackers and tinkerers on a boat in Germany. No internet, no fixed schedule - just talks, sailing, wind, food and great people. ([More details about Nerdboat](https://tito.io/nerdboat/nerdboat-2013))

However, since the boat has quite a big price tag and there are no sponsors, the tickets are far from being cheap. On the other hand, there are a lot of awesome, passionate and talented people out there which dont have 750 Euros spare for a weekend. This sucks, since the weekend will be better the more interesting people gather aboard. 

So here is the deal: I will give out one ticket for free for the person which provides the best reason why she/he should get it.

How to participate:
---

* To apply for the ticket grant, file a new [issue](https://github.com/nerdboat/tickets/issues) here at github. Please write some text why you want to be on the boat.
* __Voting__: The issue with the most participants gets the ticket. So ask your friends to raise this number by commenting on the ticket. 
* Deadline is August, 28th, 2013.


FAQ/Rules:
---
* Spamming sucks. While it is perfectly fine to ask on twitter or somewhere else to participate on the issue, please use only socially accepted communication methods. Don't annoy other people, and be excellent to each other. Otherwise: See next paragraph.
* I reserve the right to exclude participants from the application for highly subjective and not explained reasons. :)
* The nerdboat ticket grant project does only cover the ticket itself. Transport to/from Hamburg has to be paid for by everyone itself.
* You might want to register your interest at [tito.io](https://tito.io/nerdboat/nerdboat-2013) to get the newsletter for the boat.
